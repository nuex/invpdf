Generate PDF invoices from text files.

## SYNOPSIS

    invpdf [OPTION]... INVOICE_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

## DEPENDENCIES

LaTeX and the latex-invoice package is required to generate the PDF. Installing
these is usually as easy as installing the texlive-latex-extra package in
Ubuntu or ArchLinux.

## INSTALL

    git clone git://github.com/nuex/invpdf.git
    cd invpdf
    export PATH="$(pwd)/bin:$PATH"
    export INV_AWKLIB="$(pwd)/lib"

## DESCRIPTION

invpdf works by parsing a text file database of customers and the invoice text
file, then using various LaTeX utilities, generates the result PDF.

The following command generates a PDF using the passed in customers database
and invoice:

    invpdf -c=example/customers.txt example/0001.txt example/0001.pdf

If you set the INV_CUSTOMERS environment variable to the path of your customers database, you can
generate invoice with the following path:

    invpdf example/0001.txt example/0001.pdf

## OPTIONS

    -c=<path>
        Set the path to the customer database file. Equivalent to setting the
        INV_CUSTOMERS environment variable.

    -l=<closing>
        Set the closing text for the invoice. Equivalent to setting the
        INV_CLOSING environment variable.

## CUSTOMER FILE

The customers database file will be used to display the customer address in the
exported invoice. The company name is used as a unique ID to reference the
company in an invoice.

Example customer database:

    MYCOMPANY
    Somewhere Dr.
    Boston, MA 10491
    1-800-PAYME

    ACME
    400 Main St.
